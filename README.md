The JS file takes in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has certain attributes of a restaurant listed in it.

Users of this file must make sure to make json files with dictionaries of the exact same type in order to not have errors (if an attribute is missing, the FluentRestaurants class will attempt to access it resulting in an error).

This is a solution to Project 4 in COMPSCI 220 at UMass.
